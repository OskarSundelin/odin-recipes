    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
            Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
            Gradually stir in flour mixture, then stir in floured dates and walnuts until well combined. 
            Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. 
            Reduce the heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and bake until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 
            30 to 40 minutes.</li>

        <li>Cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before cutting into 36 bars.</li>
