    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1 cup dates, pitted and chopped</li>

        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>

        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>

        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>

        <li>3 large eggs</li>

        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>

        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>

        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
            Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>

        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
            Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
            Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
            Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. 
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
